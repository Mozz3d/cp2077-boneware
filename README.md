## Usage

The lib can be used in two ways: as a shared or internal lib. 

### Shared

You can add the lib as a dependency.

### Internal

You can include a full or partial copy of the lib with only features you need in your mod. 

To prevent conflicts with other mods and / or shared lib, you must give your copy a unique namespace.
For example, you can simply use your mod's namespace or prepend with it: `Codeware` â†’ `MyMod.Codeware`.
